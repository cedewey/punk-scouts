# punk-scouts
Punk Scouts combines the outdoorsiness of boy scouts and girl scouts while rejecting the gender binary, nationalism, homophobia, colonialism and all the other baggage that come with traditional scouting. We take that and infuse it with the diy ethics of punk rock to create a youth-led space of amazingness.
